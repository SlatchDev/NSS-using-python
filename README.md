# Natural Selection Simulation (NSS) using python
This code isn't cleaned or optimized nor organized, It was just a school project but i'm planning to work on recreating it with better performance, visualization and code. (Not willing to update this one, I will create an entirely new one)

## Dependencies 
- python3 Installed on machine
- pandas (For computing data)
- matplotlib (For graphing results from data files)
- numpy (For mathematical operations)

## Instructions
- Place main.py file and Data folder in the same directory
- In CMD excute `pip install pandas` `pip install matplotlib` numpy should be installed automatically with matplotlib.. If not then excute `pip install numpy`
- Run main.py using python3 
- Input days and counts of food 
- watch the magic happen!

## Notes ❗️
- Only tested succesfull for windows 10, Produced an error on Linux mint 20.3 Not sure about the rest.
- Takes so long to give resutls and consumes alot of resources if too many days and food were specefied due to bad optimization as I said.
- Isn't accurate and has some faults when it comes to real natural selection and genetics.
